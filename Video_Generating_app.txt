Output:  As an experienced project manager, I would recommend following a structured and iterative approach to developing the app. Here's a suggested step-by-step plan:

Requirements Gathering and Analysis:
Start by thoroughly understanding the app's objectives, target audience, and desired features. Gather requirements from stakeholders and create a detailed project scope document. Identify the core functionalities and prioritize them based on their importance and complexity.
Design and User Experience (UX) Planning:
Work closely with the UX/UI designer to create wireframes and mockups of the app's interface. Focus on designing an intuitive user experience that aligns with your target audience's expectations. Consider the flow of the video creation process and ensure it's user-friendly and efficient.
Back-end Development and API Design:
Begin the development of the back-end components required for video snippet management, categorization, and tagging. Design and implement the necessary APIs for data retrieval and storage. Coordinate with the backend developer to establish a robust foundation for the app.

Front-end Development:
Simultaneously, start developing the front-end of the app, focusing on the user interface and video processing functionalities. Implement screens for script input, video snippet selection, and video preview. Collaborate closely with the UX/UI designer and the Android developer to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing app.
Basic Video Snippet Integration:
Begin by integrating a basic video snippet merging functionality into the app. This initial version may not consider keyword matching or advanced transitions but should provide a basic output of merged video snippets based on the provided script and length.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Integration:
Once the core functionality is working, integrate NLP algorithms and models to extract keywords from the script and match them with categorized video snippets. Collaborate with the NLP expert to fine-tune the keyword extraction and matching process.
Advanced Video Editing Features:
Enhance the video editing capabilities of the app by implementing advanced transitions, effects, and customization options. Work closely with the video processing expert to ensure smooth merging of video snippets and high-quality output.
Testing and Quality Assurance:
Conduct thorough testing of the app's functionality, including video merging, keyword matching, and overall performance. Involve the QA engineer in creating test cases, performing manual and automated tests, and fixing any bugs or issues that arise.
Deployment and Iterative Improvements:
Once the app is stable and meets the desired quality standards, deploy it to the app stores. Gather user feedback and monitor app performance. Continuously iterate and improve the app based on user feedback, introducing new features, enhancing existing functionalities, and optimizing performance.


* Prompt-3 -> Development of back-end:->
  ""“ignore all the previous information. Act as an experienced back-end python developer who has 10 years of experience in back-end development. Your task is to develope back-end which can store video snippets with unique vebral tags.”""

Output:
Choose the Technology Stack:
Select a suitable technology stack for your back-end development in Python. Consider using a web framework like Django or Flask, along with a database management system like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Design the Database Schema:
Define the database schema to store video snippets and their corresponding verbal tags. Identify the required entities and their relationships. For example, you might have tables for videos, tags, and a mapping table to associate tags with videos.
Set Up the Project:
Create a new project using your chosen framework. Set up the project structure, including necessary folders, configuration files, and dependencies.
Create Models:
Define the models that represent the entities in your database schema. Create a model for video snippets and another model for verbal tags. Establish the necessary relationships between these models using foreign key or many-to-many relationships.

Implement API Endpoints:
Create API endpoints for interacting with the back-end system. Define endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for video snippets and verbal tags. Use your chosen framework's routing mechanism to map URLs to corresponding endpoint functions.

Handle Video Snippet Upload:
Implement an endpoint for uploading video snippets to the server. Handle the video file and associated metadata such as title, description, and duration. Save the video file in a designated folder and store the metadata in the database.

Manage Verbal Tags:
Create endpoints for managing verbal tags. Allow users to add, edit, and delete verbal tags associated with video snippets. Implement necessary validation and error handling to ensure data integrity.

Tag Association:
Create an endpoint to associate verbal tags with video snippets. Allow users to assign one or multiple verbal tags to a video snippet. Store this association in the database, linking the video snippet with the corresponding verbal tags.

Querying and Searching:
Implement endpoints to query and search for video snippets based on verbal tags. Allow users to retrieve video snippets that match specific verbal tags or perform keyword-based searches. Utilize efficient database queries to optimize search performance.

Security and Authentication:
Implement authentication mechanisms to secure the API endpoints. Use techniques such as token-based authentication or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate and authorize user access to protected endpoints.


Testing and Deployment:
Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your API endpoints. Test the API using tools like Postman to verify the expected behavior. Once the back-end is thoroughly tested, deploy it to a server or cloud platform.

Documentation and Maintenance:
Document the API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms. Provide clear instructions for other developers on how to consume your API. Regularly update and maintain the back-end codebase to address security vulnerabilities, optimize performance, and accommodate future enhancements.
